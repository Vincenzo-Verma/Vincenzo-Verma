## About Me 👨‍💻

- 🏠 Currently based in India (where the traffic 🚗 is worse than merge conflicts 🔀)
- 🎯 Data Scientist with a passion for web apps 🌐 and ML magic ✨
- 🌱 Turning raw data into meaningful insights, one pandas 🐼 DataFrame at a time
- 💻 Building web applications that make complex data simple (and hopefully don't crash) 💥
- 🎨 Believer in beautiful code 💻 and even more beautiful visualizations 📊
- 🧠 Professional overthinker and amateur plant parent 🪴 (both coding and plants require patience)

## What Keeps Me Busy 🏃‍♂️

- **🤖 Machine Learning Engineering:**  
  Creating models that actually work in production (most of the time) 📈  
  _"Teaching machines to be smart so I can be lazy"_ 😴

- **📊 Data Analytics:**  
  Finding patterns in chaos 🌪️ and convincing stakeholders they matter 💼  
  _"Making numbers tell stories ...."_ 📺
  
- **🌐 Full-Stack Development:**  
  From APIs to UIs—making data science accessible to humans
  _"I speak fluent frontend and backend... mostly backend"_ 🗣️

## My Arsenal 🛡️⚔️

**🐍 Core Languages:**
- Python (my partner in crimes)
- JavaScript (it's complicated ... but we make it work)
- R (weekend hobby 📅 and statistical therapy)
- SQL 

**🌐 Web Technologies:**
- Django, Flask, FastAPI (the holy trinity ⛪)
- Vue.js, Angular (frontend wizardry 🪄)
- HTML/CSS (yes, I can center a div 🎯... usually)
- Node.js (JavaScript everywhere 🌍)

**🧠 ML & Data:**
- Pandas 🐼, NumPy 🔢, SciPy 🧪
- Keras, PyTorch (neural network whisperer 🗣️)
- Apache Spark ⚡ (for when pandas isn't enough)
- Scikit-learn 📚 (the Swiss Army knife 🔪)

**☁️ Infrastructure:**
- Docker 🐳, Kubernetes ⚓ (containerization station 📦)
- AWS ☁️, Azure 🌤️ (cloud nine vibes)
- Git 📝 (and the occasional `git push --force` 💪)
- Linux 🐧 (penguin power!)

## Philosophy 💭🧘‍♂️

> _"The best machine learning model is the one that solves the right problem."_ 🎯

> _"Code is like humor. When you have to explain it, it's bad."_ 😂

> _"There are only two kinds of languages: the ones people complain about and the ones nobody uses."_ 🗣️💻

## Fun Facts About My Coding Life 🎭💻

- I speak fluent Python 🐍 but still struggle with small talk 🗣️
- My code is 80% comments, 20% actual code 📝 (mostly apologies to future me)
- I've googled "how to exit vim" more times than I care to admit 😅
- My rubber duck 🦆 has heard more confessions than a priest 🙏

_If you've read this far, you probably understand the struggle of explaining why your model has 99% accuracy on training data but performs like a coin flip in production._ 🪙🎯

_Also, you deserve a cup of chai/coffee ☕ and a cookie 🍪_
